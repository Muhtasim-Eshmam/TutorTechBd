                Be honest. This helps to establish rapport and trust, the two most critical elements to a successful tutoring relationship.
                
                Be flexible. This means being willing to adjust techniques and approaches to meet the learning styles of the student.
                
                Be patient. What is obvious or easy for you may not be so for your student. Learn not to show annoyance in your speech or body language.
                
                Be a good listener. Learn to pick up clues in your student?s speech that enable you to understand how he is really feeling. A good listener does not dominate the conversation!
                
                Be professional. Except for discussing your student with SSS staff and/or faculty, information about the student must be kept confidential.
                
                Be willing to share your own experiences. By sharing information about what you have encountered, the student may feel relieved that he is not alone. Sharing experiences and lessons learned goes a long way toward building trust and support. It also helps the student build self-confidence.
